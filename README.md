sketches
========

ios app created for my new forms of drawing workshop w/ Ars Electronica in Osaka.  Requires OF 0.7.4 IOS. 

It combines alot of the sketches made for the workshop I taught with Shantell Martin at eyeo into one application and also has some IOS specific drawing scenes, like using the gyro to draw, etc. 

Alot of this code was smashed together in a very jetlagged state at a 24 hour restaurant behind the hotel, so it's not the cleanest.  but there's some nice ideas here.
